# Egg_Chicken_Problem


- Chicken implements the Birdlnterface base class.
- A Chicken lays an egg that will hatch into a new Chicken.
- Eggs from other types of birds should hatch into a new bird of their parent type.
- Hatching an egg for the second time throws a System.lnvalidOperationException.
